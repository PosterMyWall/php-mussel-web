config:
 web_custom_header: "Inserted as HTML at the very beginning of all "upload denied" pages. This could be useful in case you want to include a website logo, personalized header, scripts, or similar at all such pages."
 web_ignore_upload_errors: "This directive should generally be disabled unless it's required for correct functionality of phpMussel on your specific system. Normally, when disabled, when phpMussel detects the presence of elements in the <code>$_FILES</code> array(), it'll attempt to initiate a scan of the files that those elements represent, and, if those elements are blank or empty, phpMussel will return an error message. This is proper behavior for phpMussel. However, for some CMS, empty elements in <code>$_FILES</code> can occur as a result of the natural behavior of those CMS, or errors may be reported when there aren't any, in which case, the normal behavior for phpMussel will be interfering with the normal behavior of those CMS. If such a situation occurs for you, enabling this option will instruct phpMussel to not attempt to initiate scans for such empty elements, ignore them when found and to not return any related error messages, thus allowing continuation of the page request. False = OFF; True = ON."
scan_unauthorised_upload: "Unauthorized file upload manipulation detected!"
scan_unauthorised_upload_or_misconfig: "Unauthorized file upload manipulation or misconfiguration detected!"
